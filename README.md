Ibotta Anagram Project
=========

Live demo available at: https://ibotta-anagrams-api.herokuapp.com/

#### Ruby 2.4.4
#### Rails 5.1.6

---
The project is to build an API that allows fast searches for [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram). `dictionary.txt` is a text file containing every word in the English dictionary. Ingesting the file doesnâ€™t need to be fast, and you can store as much data in memory as you like.

### Endpoints
```
  curl https://ibotta-anagrams-api.herokuapp.com/

  {
    "app": "ibotta_anagrams",
    "description": "API that allows fast searches for anagrams."
  }
```

POST JSON data of English-language words and adds them to the corpus
```
  curl -i -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -X POST -d '{ "words": ["read", "dear"] }' https://ibotta-anagrams-api.herokuapp.com/words

  {
    "words": [
      {
        "word":"read",
        "proper_noun":false
      },
      {
        "word":"dear",
        "proper_noun":false
      }
    ]
  }

  # An error is expected if the word exists in the corpus
  curl -i -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -X POST -d '{ "words": ["read"] }' https://ibotta-anagrams-api.herokuapp.com/words

  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "word": [ "already exists in corpus: read" ]
      }
    ]
  }
```

Return a JSON array of English-language words that are anagrams of the word passed in the URL.
```
  curl -i https://ibotta-anagrams-api.herokuapp.com/anagram/read

  {
    "meta":{
      "limit":1000,
      "offset":1,
      "sort":"asc",
      "total":2,
      "word":"read"
    },
    "anagrams":[ "dare","dear" ]
  }

  curl -i https://ibotta-anagrams-api.herokuapp.com/anagram/read?limit=1

  {
    "meta":{
      "limit":1,
      "offset":1,
      "sort":"asc",
      "total":2,
      "word":"read"
    },
    "anagrams":[ "dare" ]
  }
```

Delete a single word from the data store.
```
  curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/words/read

  HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

Delete all contents of the data store.
```
  curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/words

  HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

*Note: This project is a work in progress*

**Optional**
- Endpoint that returns a count of words in the corpus and min/max/median/average word length
- Respect a query param for whether or not to include proper nouns in the list of anagrams
- Endpoint that identifies words with the most anagrams
- Endpoint that takes a set of words and returns whether or not they are all anagrams of each other
- Endpoint to return all anagram groups of size >= *x*
- Endpoint to delete a word *and all of its anagrams*

### Dependencies

This service has dependencies on the following services:

1. Ruby `2.4.4`
1. MongoDB
1. Redis
1. Sidekiq

### Docker
Follow the Docker [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide to get `docker` and `docker-compose`.  This project contains helper scripts to build and test services.

1. Run the test suite: `$ script/test`

#### Local development
To start the application using docker compose locally:

1. Start the services: `$ docker-compose up --build`
1. Access Sidekiq via browser: `$ open http://localhost:3000/sidekiq`

### Local development (without Docker)
To start the application from project folder:

1. Start Redis: `$ redis-server`
1. Start Sidekiq: `$ bundle exec sidekiq`
1. Start App: `$ rails s`
1. Access Sidekiq via browser: `$ open http://localhost:3000/sidekiq`

### Database

#### Create Indexes

A rake task needs to be executed the first time the project is set up in order to create Mongo indexes.

1. `docker-compose run app rake db:create_indexes` (Docker)
1. `rake db:create_indexes` (Local)

#### Seed Database

A rake task was created in order to seed the database with the provided `dictionary.txt.gz` file.
This task is designed to use Sidekiq to enqueue and process the dictionary in ascending order.

*Note: The default word limit is **1_000***

1. `docker-compose run app rake dictionary:enqueue` (Docker)
1. `rake dictionary:enqueue` (Local)
1. `rake dictionary:enqueue\[50\]` (First 50 words)

### Testing

With the services running, the provided test suite can be executed by running the following command:

1. `$ ruby vendor/ibotta/anagram_test.rb`

#### Rspec

The project includes a test suite for all major functionality of the API.

1. `script/test` (Docker)
1. `bundle exec rspec` (Local)

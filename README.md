Ibotta Anagram Project
=========

#### Ruby 2.4.4
#### Rails 5.1.6

---
The project is to build an API that allows fast searches for [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram). `dictionary.txt` is a text file containing every word in the English dictionary. Ingesting the file doesnâ€™t need to be fast, and you can store as much data in memory as you like.

The API you design should respond on the following endpoints as specified.

- `POST /words.json`: Takes a JSON array of English-language words and adds them to the corpus (data store).
- `GET /anagrams/:word.json`:
  - Returns a JSON array of English-language words that are anagrams of the word passed in the URL.
  - This endpoint should support an optional query param that indicates the maximum number of results to return.
- `DELETE /words/:word.json`: Deletes a single word from the data store.
- `DELETE /words.json`: Deletes all contents of the data store.

*Note: This project is a work in progress*

**Optional**
- Endpoint that returns a count of words in the corpus and min/max/median/average word length
- Respect a query param for whether or not to include proper nouns in the list of anagrams
- Endpoint that identifies words with the most anagrams
- Endpoint that takes a set of words and returns whether or not they are all anagrams of each other
- Endpoint to return all anagram groups of size >= *x*
- Endpoint to delete a word *and all of its anagrams*

### Dependencies

This service has dependencies on the following services:

1. Ruby `2.4.4`
1. MongoDB
1. Redis
1. Sidekiq

### Docker
Follow the Docker [Getting Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) guide to get `docker` and `docker-compose`.  This project contains helper scripts to build and test services.

1. Run the test suite: `$ script/test`

#### Local development
To start the application using docker compose locally:

1. Start the services: `$ docker-compose up --build`
1. Access Sidekiq via browser: `$ open http://localhost:3000/sidekiq`

### Local development (without Docker)
To start the application from project folder:

1. Start Redis: `$ redis-server`
1. Start Sidekiq: `$ bundle exec sidekiq`
1. Start App: `$ rails s`
1. Access Sidekiq via browser: `$ open http://localhost:3000/sidekiq`

### Database

#### Create Indexes

A rake task needs to be executed the first time the project is set up in order to create Mongo indexes.

1. `docker-compose run app rake db:create_indexes` (Docker)
1. `rake db:create_indexes` (Local)

#### Seed Database

A rake task was created in order to seed the database with the provided `dictionary.txt.gz` file.
This task is designed to use Sidekiq to enqueue and process the dictionary in ascending order.

*Note: The default word limit is **1_000***

1. `docker-compose run app rake dictionary:enqueue` (Docker)
1. `rake dictionary:enqueue` (Local)
1. `rake dictionary:enqueue\[50\]` (First 50 words)

### Testing

With the services running, the provided test suite can be executed by running the following command:

1. `$ ruby vendor/ibotta/anagram_test.rb`

#### Rspec

The project includes a test suite for all major functionality of the API.

1. `script/test` (Docker)
1. `bundle exec rspec` (Local)

Ibotta Anagram Project
=========

#### Ruby 2.4.4
#### Rails 5.1.6

---
The project is to build an API that allows fast searches for [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram). `dictionary.txt` is a text file containing every word in the English dictionary. Ingesting the file doesnâ€™t need to be fast, and you can store as much data in memory as you like.

The API you design should respond on the following endpoints as specified.

- `POST /words.json`: Takes a JSON array of English-language words and adds them to the corpus (data store).
- `GET /anagrams/:word.json`:
  - Returns a JSON array of English-language words that are anagrams of the word passed in the URL.
  - This endpoint should support an optional query param that indicates the maximum number of results to return.
- `DELETE /words/:word.json`: Deletes a single word from the data store.
- `DELETE /words.json`: Deletes all contents of the data store.


**Optional**
- Endpoint that returns a count of words in the corpus and min/max/median/average word length
- Respect a query param for whether or not to include proper nouns in the list of anagrams
- Endpoint that identifies words with the most anagrams
- Endpoint that takes a set of words and returns whether or not they are all anagrams of each other
- Endpoint to return all anagram groups of size >= *x*
- Endpoint to delete a word *and all of its anagrams*

*Note: This project is a work in progress*
